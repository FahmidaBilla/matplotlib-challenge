  Pymaceuticals, Inc.,is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

  In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
  
  According to the summary statistics based on the data collected for 10 drug regimens, Ramicane and Capomulin has the lowest Std. Deviation. This indicates that the data collected for these two regimens are more clustured around mean and data collected is more reliable than the others. The Bar chars derived from the data tells us that highest number of study was treated by the drug of interest, Capomulin. Whereas, lowest number of study was treated by Propriva.
  
  The Pie Charts show that, study was almost equally performed among female and male mice. The number of male mice used for the study was only 2% higher than the female. Since the difference is not significant, the sex of study subjects might not be a significant variable in the study.
  
  As per the quartiles, outliers and boxplot results for the Final Tumor Volume of each mouse across the four drug regimens, Capomulin and Ramicane has the lowest average final tumor volume. However, the study group for Capomulin is a bit higher than Ramican, which could effect the results. To get more accurate result, study should be conducted on the same number of mice. Among the four drug regimens, only Infubinol has one outlier located below the minimun value.
  
  The line chart indicates a decreasing trend between Tumor Volume and Timepoint for the Capomulin regimen. Tumor Volume tends decrease overtime due to the treatment.
  
  On the other hand, the correlation between Average Weight and Average Tumor Volume is 0.84, which indicates a strong positive relation between both factors. The r-squared 0.71 indicates that the liner model might be a good fit for the data and the Average Tumor Volume could be predicted by Average Weight of mice. To get a better view on the relationship, different hypothesis tests could be conducted.
